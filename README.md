## FAQ

**Q:** How is this addon related to Glass by mixxorz?  
**A:** Originally, the goal was to take over that addon and maintain it. However, after reviewing the original code to figure out what I needed to do to update it for the Dragonflight expansion I decided to start from scratch. But it's fair to say that the addon is inspired by Glass, hence its name.
