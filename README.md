# Disclaimer

This fork is largely for my own personal use and experiments. I'm still not sure about taking the addon over because it'll require a pretty substantial rewrite to make it not break anything in the default UI. If someone else takes it over in the meantime, no biggie üòÅ

## An update from 28/10/2022

Right now it's basically impossible to handle clicking any chat links (player names, item links, etc) via `SetItemRef` in an addon that replaces the default chat output (like this one) and doesn't just customise/reskin it (like Prat). If you call it, you won't be able to close chat tabs while in combat, the default layout editor will go haywire, etc. It's not something I can ignore because it's the most basic and fundamental chat feature. This project is def put on the backburner.

## An update from 31/10/2022

I found a workaround for the issue mentioned above. There's one handy XML-only attribute called `propagateHyperlinksToParent` that can be chained. As long as a chat message has `ChatFrame#` in its parent hierarchy and all the frames in between use the following template

```xml
<Frame name="YourHyperlinkPropagator" propagateHyperlinksToParent="true" virtual="true"/>
```

hyperlinks from that chat message will reach `ChatFrame#` and it'll handle them via `SetItemRef` without tainting anything.
