### Known Issues

- There's a bug where the chat frame sometimes stops updating properly after scrolling down with
  the mouse wheel. It's a tricky one to fix, I'm still investigating it. But to resume the update
  process you need to scroll up until you see the "Jump to Present"/"Unread Messages" button and
  then click it.

- Fixed more issues related to fasting forward. Those pesky line#340 errors.

- Fixed an issue where messages' background gradient wouldn't resize properly.

  The max is uncapped.
